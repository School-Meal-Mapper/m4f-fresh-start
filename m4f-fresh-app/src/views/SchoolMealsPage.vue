    <h2>USDA Prototype Applications</h2>
    <p>
      USDA offers prototypes (examples) of school meal applications, as well as sample instructional documents intended to assist state and
      local officials in the design and distribution of their own application materials. These application prototypes meet all legal
      requirements and reflect design best practices identified by USDA through focus testing and other research. They are available in both
      paper and web-based formats and may be adapted by state or local agencies for household use.

    <h2>Paper-Based Prototype Household Application</h2>
    <p>
      Below is the Prototype Application for Free and Reduced Price School Meals, with accompanying instructions, letter to households, and
      other materials for state and local agencies. The prototype may be used by state and local agencies as an example when designing a new
      application packet. The current prototype design was first launched in SY 2015 and is the result of a year-long project to revise the
      prototype to make the application process easier for households and school officials, as well as more accurate.
